            <strong>Dear Future Ivin,</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <br>
            When you finally come out of the shell, you see distractions, like you may start getting in trouble.
             Your energy and love are infectious. You have a knowing way about you that is wise, patient, and graceful. You see, 
             everything is always in the right order and what I am going through right now is part of my bigger plan. It’s as if 
             you know that all of this turbulence and stress were divinely put into my life to help me become the person I needed 
             to be, the person that you are.
            I know that you’re so proud of me for learning these lessons, for rolling up my sleeves and doing the work on myself 
            that’s required—for getting into the trenches of my own life to prepare me for my next chapter. You’re oozing with 
            awareness, and you see that I am getting it. Day by day, I am trying, and I am learning.
            I choose to work toward you by taking charge of my life.You smile because you see that I get it; that the choices I 
            make today affect you and your daily life in the future. You see, I am showing up and doing the best I can. You see, 
            what may feel like not enough, even a failure, to me, is more than enough in your eyes. You should be proud and 
            honored to have been me.
            I see that somewhere between you and me, we have figured it out. I am so thankful that you take care of yourself 
            every single day. I am so honored to be you. The most powerful thing you are showing me is what is possible in our 
            lives. I can’t wait to meet you.
            You are not defined by your problems or any situation that you find yourself in. You ride the waves of life with such
             ease that it makes me want to catch up with you faster. I see that, together, we can figure it out. I know that my 
             life is a moment-by-moment web of intricate experiences and reactions that help me shape you. I am working to make 
             myself better for you and for us.
            But soon you will understand that learning in school helps you to be a smarter and better person. Leave your friends 
            alone unless they are at school for a good reason. I have learned throughout the years that if you cut everything out
             of your time right now and focus, you’ll see change. If you work on your life right now, we will all smile at you. 
             Today’s society is bad, but I believe you can do it.
            As life goes on, things get more complicated. You are no longer a child but an adult who faces reality. To you, real 
            life is nothing like a fairy tale. Problems are not being easily solved, and confusion is everywhere. There is never 
            a long period of rest and peace. You should always be aware of everything that is preventing you from living an easy 
            life. Moments of sadness and misery are much more frequent than those of happiness, filling your head with indescribable
             madness. No one is really right or wrong. Every person you trust may suddenly be gone. Now you wonder if every choice you 
             make in life is a bet. What you can only do is trust your instincts and prepare for the worst.
